# Sport Concussion Assessment Applicaiton 

The Sport Concussion Assessmnet Applcatin aims to help sport medical practitioners make a more timely diagnosis of concussions and avoid subsequent issues that could put the athletesâ€™ well-being at risk. Students developing the app will get hands-on experience with topics discussed in the unit, including actors, use cases, use-case diagrams, object
identification, class diagram development, and Java implementation.

## Application Behaviour 

Use Java to develop a console application (NO need to have a graphical user interface) that
implements the functionalities described in Parts A, B, and C below. Implement only the
functionality for the athletes (not the medical practitioners); however, the design completed during Phases 1 and 2 should be for the complete system (i.e., athletes and medical practitioners).

## Objectives
1. Create Class diagram and Use-Case Diagram using proper UML notations
2. Implemenet the athlete application using Java 

### Use Case Diagram
